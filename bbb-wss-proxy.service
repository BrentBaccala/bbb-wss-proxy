# We could use User=nobody because bigbluebutton.properties is currently
# world-readable, but I anticipate that this will change since that file
# contains a copy of the API key (which is why we need to read it), so
# I'd prefer User=bigbluebutton, but the program can't seem to connect
# to the VNC server unless it's running as root.
